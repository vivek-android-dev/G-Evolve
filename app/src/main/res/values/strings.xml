From smartphones to laptops, these gadgets have become an important part of our daily lives, but also contribute significantly to the global waste problem. The rapid advancement in technology leads to decreased device lifespans, causing an unprecedented amount of e-waste. This trend poses serious environmental and health risks due to the toxic substances found in electronic devices.E-waste can release harmful toxins into the environment, contaminating soil and water sources. These toxins include lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can have detrimental effects on human health and biodiversity.</string>
    <string name="about3"><![CDATA[Approximately 24.9 Mt of e-waste was produced in Asia in 2019, followed by 13.1 Mt in America, 12 Mt in Europe, 2.9 Mt in Africa, and 0.7 Mt in Oceania. E-waste output has dramatically increased due to the technology sectorâ€™s ongoing growth, shorter product life cycles, and customer demand for newer gadgets. Several significant decisions that affect the health and welfare of our planet must be made from the time an electronic product is conceived until its eventual recycling or destruction. Understanding the e-waste lifecycle & electronic waste management will help us all fight to reduce its negative consequences and promote a circular economy that puts environmental protection and resource conservation first. The life of e-waste begins with the spread of the newest electronic devices, which entice customers with their cutting-edge features and functionalities. The pull of newer models forces the inevitable replacement of older ones as technological development accelerates. As a result, abandoned electronics start their journey as e-waste, prompting the development of strategic management solutions to address this escalating problem. Beyond just affecting individual customers, this urgent issue has enormous implications for corporations, notably in the IT industry. Computer systems, servers, and other electronic equipment frequently undergo updates due to the unrelenting pace of invention, which significantly adds to the growing electronic waste stream. As soon as the electrical gadget reaches the end of its useful life, it has to be disposed of correctly.]]></string>
